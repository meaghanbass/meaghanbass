# Hi, I'm Meaghan 👋🏻 👩🏼‍💻

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating unique experiences and interactions in technology. Some of the things I really enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack, and GraphQL. Most recently I've been diving into some game development and AV & VR, which is super fascinating.
